#  Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.


## ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

---

##  Program
```
class Rectangle:
    __length = 0 
    __breadth = 0
    def __init__(self):
      self.__length = 5
      self.__breadth = 3
      print(self.__length)
      print(self.__breadth)
   
  obj = Rectangle()
```
## Output
<img width="290" height="132" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9492aae-2ce7-4bff-98dc-1565ff3966b3" />

## Result
Thus, the program to implement Encapsulation with Private Members in Python was executed successfully and produced the expected result.
